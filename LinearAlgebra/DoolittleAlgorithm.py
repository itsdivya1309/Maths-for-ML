LU Decomposition of matix

LU decomposition factors a matrix as the product of a lower 
triangular matrix and an upper triangular matrix.
Computers usually solve square systems of linear equations using 
the LU decomposition, and it is also a key step when inverting a 
matrix, or computing the determinant of a matrix. The LU 
decomposition was introduced by mathematician Tadeusz Banachiewicz 
in 1938.

Doolittleâ€™s method provides an alternative way to factor A into an 
LU decomposition without going through the hassle of Gaussian 
Elimination.
